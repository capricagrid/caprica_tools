# manage the OpenSim process for Your Sim
#
#
# see 'daemon' setting in /etc/monit/monitrc for the cycle length.
# on ubuntu/debian, this is overridden by the CHECK_INTERVALS var in
# /etc/default/monit .  the below assumes you've set it to 30 seconds.
#
# if process dies, will restart sim within 30 seconds.  if process
# dies 5 times in as many tries, will stop trying and send email
# alert.
#
# if SimFPS drops to 0 for 2 minutes, restart.
#
# if process CPU usage stays above 300% for 2 minutes, restart.
#
# see ../README for configuration instructions.

check process opensim with pidfile /opt/os/bin/opensim.pid
    start program = "/etc/init.d/opensim start"
        group root
    stop program = "/etc/init.d/opensim stop"
    if cpu usage > 300% for 4 cycles then restart
    if 5 restarts within 5 cycles then timeout
    if failed url http://caprica.1studi.ru:9000/jsonSimStats/
        and content != '"SimFPS":0.0,' for 4 cycles
        then restart
    if failed url http://caprica.1studi.ru:9000/jsonSimStats/
        and content == '"SimFPS":' for 4 cycles
then restart
